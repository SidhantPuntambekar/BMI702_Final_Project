# Tentative Project Ideas
- Cancer AI Scientist: AI agent integrating molecular, cellular, and clinical cancer data to predict therapeutic sensitivity, toxicity and survival course
- Geometric deep learning for designing and optimize molecular structures for drug purposing using public data from Gingko Bioworks
- Integrating EHRs with LLMs; combine electronic health records from MIMIC-III or MIMIC-IV with LLMs for annotation of clinical notes and diganosis prediction
